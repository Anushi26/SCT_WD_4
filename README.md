A To-Do App is a simple productivity tool that allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks. It helps organize daily activities and keeps track of tasks in a clean, easy-to-use interface.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic front-end development skills.
